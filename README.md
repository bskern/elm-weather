Small example of my first elm 'app'
===================================

* Uses my own (local) service that queries Yahoo! weather API
* Parses JSON
* Uses elm-css for my custom css falls back to bootstrap for those styles
* Uses webpack for dev server /hot reloading
* uses elm css for my own styles but falls back to bootstrap for its styles


runing
======
* npm start
* I hit my own api hosted locally that does transformation on weather response from Yahoo.


todo
====
* ~~use elm css & elm css helpers~~
* ~~think about gulp~~
* ~~use webpack~~
* remove local dependency so this can be standalone

Layout/webpack based on [elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter)

Small example of my first elm 'app'
===================================

* Uses Yahoo! weather API
* Parses JSON
* Uses elm-css for my custom css falls back to Bootstrap for those styles
* Uses webpack for dev server /hot reloading
* uses elm css for my own styles but falls back to Bootstrap for its styles


Customizing Location
====================
* edit url in Main.elm specifically the text query param 

Runing
======
* npm start



todo
====
* ~~use elm css & elm css helpers~~
* ~~think about gulp~~
* ~~use webpack~~
* ~~remove local dependency so this can be standalone~~

Small example of my first elm 'app'
===================================

* Uses my own (local) service that queries Yahoo! weather API
* Parses JSON
* Uses raw css
* No build tool right now beyond what is built in
* uses elm css for my own styles but falls back to bootstrap for its styles


todo
====
* ~~use elm css & elm css helpers~~
* think about gulp
